assist each other easier than ever before. With encryped messaging and secure
file sharing, CommuNOTEe brings students, with their notes, together.

# Notes
- Merging is kind of a pain. 
- git add can be skipped (if everything needs to be added) with a -a flag on the commit 

## Simon-html

- The html classes (i.e. <div class="...">) are only used when it is nice to have things grouped together. Not all of them need classes
- The <menu> tag is similar to <ul>
- Links are all relative to the current page - might be nice to have a reference point so that moving things around doesn't break links
