# Notes
- Merging is kind of a pain. 
- git add can be skipped (if everything needs to be added) with a -a flag on the commit 

## Simon-html

- The html classes (i.e. <div class="...">) are only used when it is nice to have things grouped together. Not all of them need classes
- The &lt;menu&gt; tag is similar to &lt;ul&gt;
- Links are all relative to the current page - might be nice to have a reference point so that moving things around doesn't break links

# Main Project notes

- display: block; float: &lt;direction&gt;
- bootstrap is nice, but not knowing exactly what's happening can be the cause for much debugging - better to use just the basic things and then make your own
- It's easier to shrink the size of the container than fill it with the contents.
- It never hurts to have another layer of div's
